If windows file explorer cannot find the generated file when the phone is plugged in, try these things:
- Create a copy of the file with file manager on your phone
- Create a compressed version of the file with the file manager on your phone
- Restart your phone
- Clear your phone's cache
- Remove all data from the file manager app (via device settings)
- Try a different phone
