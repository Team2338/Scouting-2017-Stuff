Privacy Policy-
This app uses a firebase server to save match data, and can be accessed by multiple teams through the GearData app.
Please note that the name of the user who inputs data is saved along with the data. This is so your team can
identify who sent in the data. Though your team number and regional code is used to separate this data it will not
stop another team with the correct numbers from looking at a specific match (No other personal data is saved
besides the name you input and your team number). Should you not feel safe using the firebase server then there
are two other options to save your data. Saving to a file on the phone, or sent through SMS text. We will not be
looking at the data sent in by other teams, but we cannot guarantee what other teams will decide to do. If you are
still having problems please contact us.
Thank you for your cooperation. -GearScout Developers
